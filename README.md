Miscellaneous things

# Integrate.jl
A simple Julia riemann-based integrator.
ARGS="f(x) a b n", where f(x) it's a julia formula for the function, [a,b] in Reals are the interval, and n the number of iteration for theriemann sums.

# Integrate.py
An "interactive" numerical integrator of numpy/python/simpy functions with several methods. It's an experiment with curses interactivity.

# N-body-simulation
An experiment with python's object-oriented capabilities and the matplotlib animator.
Allow merge between particles that generates a new one, with twice the mass and the sum of the momenta of the previous ones.
Also includes a finite space box where the particles bounce ellastically.
